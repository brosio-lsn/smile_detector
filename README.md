# Smile Detector

## Overview
The Smile Detector is an application that detects smiles based on the ratio of lips length to chin length. Utilizing image processing techniques, it first establishes a base ratio when a person is not smiling. It then compares subsequent ratios to this baseline to detect a smile. Once a smile is detected, the application briefly waits before saving the frame, ensuring the smile is captured in its optimal form.

## Key Features
- Detection of smiles based on facial feature ratios.
- Comparison of lips length to chin length to determine smiling.
- Automated saving of images when smiles are detected.

## Technical Details
- The application uses advanced image processing algorithms to measure and compare facial feature ratios.
- It accounts for the time taken for a smile to fully form, ensuring accurate detection.

## Usage
Instructions for setting up and using the Smile Detector, including requirements for image input, are detailed in the project's documentation.
